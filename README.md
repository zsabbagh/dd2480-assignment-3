# DD2480 Assignment 3
DD2480 Foundations of Software Engineering Assignment 3

## Onboarding

The project does fulfill the requirements,
and although there are duplicate entries in the 
Google Sheets, an email confirmation by Cyrille
verified that we could continue with this 
project although other groups might start working on it.

### Dependencies

The first thing that was noticed was that cloning
`keon/algorithms` did not directly state what dependencies
was required to run the tests. 
Although minor, `pytest` was required to be installed before 
the tests could be run properly.
Thus, the command `pip3 install pytest` is required for 
running the unit-tests described in the documentation.

### Building

It was very easy to build the library, considering
it was basically installed with `pip3 install` and
then possible to be included in the code.
It was easy to import a certain algorithm, as it was
simply just to do `from algorithms import ...`.

### Documentation

The documentation was not magnificent.
It was in the form of function comments and not available
through a more sophisticated website, pdf or markdown document.

### Errors

There has been no error recorded yet, except the 
one referred to under `Dependencies`.

### Tests

The library's tests runs well on the 
current system (macOS Monterey 12.2.1).

### Continuation

As this project seems feasible to grasp,
and is reasonably well-documented, we will most
likely continue with it.
